<h2> Important </h2>

<p> In this new program I correct and improve my knowledge with spring boot and mongo db, before in the old project called "Workshop_MongoDB" I had created an auxiliary class to transform timestamp id's to Long format id's, starting this new project I was able to review and learn that we should treat the id's in the mongo db as Strings and that are generated randomly without any annotations in the class, differently in the cases of relational databases ex: PostgreSQL. </p>
